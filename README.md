# SPA-utils

Usefull procedures that assist in front-end web development using plain JavaScript.

This package currently provides two modules:
* `cons.js`: exposing a single procedure `cons(...)`, that makes it possible to create UIs from nested elements with their attributes, event handlers, and more in a declarative manner (see Examples below).
* `router.js`: exposes few procedures that enable client-side routing.

## Motivation

Front-end web development in plain JavaScript is known to be notoriously tedious, on the other hand font-end frameworks usually add structure and abstraction over native web APIs, that they start getting in the way.

SPA-utils are meant to make front-end web development as fun as it should be without getting in your way -- they do not impose a certain structure, ideology or programming paradigm, just basic building blocks to help you unleash you full computer programming potential.
